# Project Name
> Driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
    - in this project we have made an attempt to check what factors are more likely to influence a loan default
    - there are also some variables which has no effect on the loan default, we have discussed them as well

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Libraries

- pandas #for data analysis
- numpy #for mathematical operations on arrays
- seaborn # for data visualization and exploratory data analysis
- matplotlib.pyplot # to plot some parameters in seaborn
- plotly.offline #enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations 
- py.init_notebook_mode(connected=True) # for offline plotly version
- plotly.graph_objs # to plot parameters
- plotly.tools # enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations
- warnings # This library will be used to ignore some warnings

## Conclusions
- 'home ownership' seem to influence a lot on, if a loan is going to default
- where as verification does not have an effect at all
